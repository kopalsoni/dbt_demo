# About models

* Models have sub-folders to differentiate between staging tables, intermediate and calculated tables.
* Tried to incorporate config, if-else, for loop in the models.
* Understood the difference between ref() and source().
* Applied aggregations and pivot easily.
* Added tests and description for documentation.
* Used incremental data upload instead to complete drop and recreation of tables.

## Best learning takeaway:
* I learned how to easily pivot tables in dbt using sql and Jinja. It much easier to understand and apply in dbt, than in sql.
